## Description

My motivation to build this portfolio is so that future employers will have the ability to view my work and assess my worthiness to work for them.
I built this portfolio to function as a virtual representation of my coding abilities.
It solves the problem of having to search for my projects, they will be included on this page and accessible by anyone who has the link to it.
I learned a lot about CSS properties, specifically border/margin/padding. I struggled a lot with flexboxes. I intend to revisit this project over winter break and fix my mistakes. I am currently very frustrated with CSS and need some time to review coursework to understand what is broken and how to fix it. I need to review information on media queries as well.
